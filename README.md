Breast Cancer Detection using Decision Tree Classifier
Overview:
This project focuses on utilizing a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer based on various attributes derived from diagnostic images. The goal is to assist in early detection and classification of tumors as malignant or benign.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project comprises diagnostic features computed from digitized images of breast mass. It includes attributes such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

Objectives:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Analyze the dataset's structure, handle missing values, and preprocess the features for model building.
Visualize relationships between attributes and their correlation with the target variable (malignant or benign).
Model Development:

Implement a Decision Tree Classifier using popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
Train the model using a subset of the dataset and evaluate its performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Evaluation and Interpretation:

Assess the Decision Tree Classifier's predictive capabilities in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.
Visualize the decision tree structure for better interpretability and insight into feature importance.
Libraries Used:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
scikit-learn
Future Enhancements:
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the Decision Tree model by tuning hyperparameters to enhance its performance.
Ensemble Techniques: Explore ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to improve predictive accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Engineer new features or select relevant attributes to refine the model.
Deployment: Develop a user-friendly interface or deploy the model for practical use in medical diagnostics.
Conclusion:
This project aims to demonstrate the application of Decision Tree Classifier in diagnosing breast cancer based on image-derived features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the goal is to contribute to early and accurate detection, potentially aiding medical professionals in decision-making processes.
